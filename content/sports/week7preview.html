          <h2>Good Teams Face Kind of Good Teams Away From Home </h2>
          <p> A quartet of teams ranked between 10 and 21 in this week's AP poll head away from where the heart is to take on solid, top-50 competition.  10th ranked Auburn travels to Baton Rouge to face LSU, fresh off a badly needed win versus Florida that could be a semi-promising reset for the (purple) Tigers' season.  Number 12 Oklahoma meets up with Texas in Dallas for a little game called the Red River Shootout, as the Longhorns look to start 3-0 in Big 12 play for the first time in four seasons.  Michigan heads to Bloomington, squaring off with an Indiana team that beat a good(?) Virginia squad and gave Ohio State 30 minutes of scare opening night.   And Michigan's brother of undetermined age, Michigan State visits Minneapolis for a night game in the rain against Minnesota, a Big 10 football team.

          <h2>Group of Five Teams Are People Too </h2>
          <p> Which non-Power 5 team will face an 11-2 Miami team in the Orange Bowl might  become a little more clear this weekend thanks to a few juicy matchups.   Lead  position in the AAC West is up for grabs as 25th ranked Navy travels to Memphis   on Saturday afternoon, in a game that should have lots and lots and lots of points.     Forget about Pac-12 After Dark (but still thank ESPN for airing the games) and catch  Boise State-San Diego State beat each other up for a few hours in pursuit of Mountain   West supremacy.  The game is important for both teams, as a win sets up San Diego   state with pretty, pretty good chances at finishing the regular season 12-0 while a loss  for Boise State would put them at 3-3 with difficult games against Wyoming and at   Colorado State remaining.  Also, keep track of how many points the explosive UCF  offense puts up against an East Carolina team allowing 47.8 points per game this year.
