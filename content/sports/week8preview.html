          <h2>I Am An American Athletic Football Watcher </h2>
          <p> 
          Both directional Florida teams sitting atop the American Athletic East standings take to the road Saturday trying to keep their seasons perfect.  Central Florida heads to Annapolis for an afternoon showdown against Navy.  The Midshipmen should be playing with a hint of urgency/desperation as their remaining schedule includes road contests at Notre Dame and Houston as well as games versus surging SMU and Army squads.  The South Florida Bulls travel to Yulman Stadium to take on a surprising though inconsistent Tulane team.  A night game with wet conditions facing a decent team means USF will probably get its first real test of the season-their closest game thus far was a two-TD win against Stony Brook.  Look for these teams, both in the top five nationally in scoring margin, to face more of a challenge on Saturday.

          <h2>Ranked Teams Play Ranked Teams Sometimes</h2>
          <p> 
            Following a week with no-ranked matchups, two matchups of the AP's chosen ones are  on the docket .  19th ranked Michigan travels to Happy Valley to play number 2 Penn   State in a matchup that looked much sexier a month ago, before Wilton Speight was   injured and the Michigan offense ate itself.  Still, it will be intriguing to watch this Penn   State team play in a big game as a favorite-this time last year the Nittany Lions were  multiple TD underdogs against the Ohio States and Michigans of the world.  The other  ranked v. ranked action sees the number 11 USC Trojans visits South Bend to face 13th   ranked Notre Dame.  Important questions for this game include "Is Notre Dame actually   good?",  "Is USC actually bad?", and is "Sam Darnold physically capable of not turning  the ball over multiple times?".  This game has the chance to be inflection point for both   schools- all five of Notre Dames remaining games are degrees of losable while USC has   a relatively soft home stretch.
