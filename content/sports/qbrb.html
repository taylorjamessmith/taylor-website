            This data is for non-triple options teams only (sorry Service Academies, GA Tech, and Eric Crouch) and was inspired by Bill Connelly asking for the best zone-read duo on Twitter today. The first sheet is single seasons and the second is career duos. For a duo to qualify, each had to run for over 500 yards in the specified season (for a single season) or in a season in the included range (for career). Also, only seasons in which both the RB and QB were starters or received a significant portion of the team's carries are included. For example, even though Fitzgerald Toussaint played in 2010 with Denard Robinson, he only carried the ball 8 times and thus can't really be said to have made up a QB-RB battery.

          <h2>#1 Northern Illinois, 2013 </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>QB Jordan Lynch-  292 rushes,  1920 yards, 23 TD</li>
            <li>RB Cameron Stingily- 203 rushes, 1119 yards, 9 TD</li>
            <li>Total-  495 rushes, 3039 yards, 32 TD</li>
          </ul>
          <p> 
            The number one QB-RB rushing combo was powered by Husky quarterback Jordan Lynch's incredible season which earned him an invite to New York and a third place Heisman finish.  Lynch set the NCAA single-game QB rushing record twice  with games of 316 and 321 yards.  Cameron Stingily supplied solid, if fluctuating (only three games over 100 yards), production from the running back position.  The Huskies averaged nearly 40 points a game on their way to a 12-0 regular season before losing the MAC Championship to Bowling Green and in the Poinsettia Bowl against Utah State.

          <h2>#2 Nevada, 2012 </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>QB Cody Fajardo- 190 rushes, 1121 yards, 12 TD</li>
            <li>RB Stefphon Jefferson- 375 rushes, 1883 yards, 24 TD </li>
            <li>Total- 565 rushes, 3004 yards,  36 TD</li>
          </ul>
          <p> 
            It is fitting that such a prolific duo was the product of legendary coach Chris Ault's final season at Nevada.  Running back Stefphon Jefferson was a  workhorse averaging over 28 carries per game with five games of 32 or more carries.  Sophomore Cody Fajardo, who would go on to accumulate 3,482 career rushing yards,  averaged close to six yards per carry and tallied a career best for rushing yards in a season.

          <h2>#3 West Virginia, 2006 </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>QB Pat White- 165 rushes, 1219 yards, 18 TD</li>
            <li>RB Steve Slaton- 248 rushes, 1744 yards, 16 TD</li>
            <li>Total- 413 rushes, 2963 yards, 34 TD</li>
          </ul>
          <p> 
            Ask  a college football fan for the best quarterback-running back rushing combo ever and there is a good chance they will answer Pat White and Steve Slaton.  During their stunningly productive careers,  the Mountaineers' pair  had their most successful single season in 2006 as sophomores.   Slaton averaged over eight  yards a carry in six different contests while White recorded multiple four touchdown games.   Combined, the duo scored touchdowns on over eight percent of their carries en route to the nation's third best scoring offense and a top-ten AP Poll finish for Rich Rodriguez' burgeoning West Virginia program.

          <h2>#4 Kansas State, 2003 </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>QB Ell Roberson- 227 rushes, 975 yards, 15 TD</li>
            <li>RB Darren Sproles- 306 rushes, 1986 yards 16 TD</li>
            <li>Total- 533 rushes, 2961 yards, 31 TD</li>
          </ul>
          <p> 
            Bill Snyder and the Kansas State coaching staff created an intriguing amalgam of early read-option concepts and traditional I-formation running plays to unleash a huge season from the shifty Roberson and the explosive Sproles.   During a year in which he gained 2,735 total yards, Sproles had his best games at the biggest moments; he ran for 140 yards against Nebraska to secure the Big-12 North title and gashed number one Oklahoma for 235 yards in the Purple Cats' 35-7 shellacking of the undefeated Sooners in the  Big 12 Championship game . Roberson was a consistent complement to Sproles' electricity, scoring multiple rushing TDs in five games.

          <h2>#5 Texas, 2004 </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>QB Vince Young- 167 rushes, 1079 yards, 14 TD</li>
            <li>RB Cedric Benson- 326 rushes, 1834 yards, 22 TD</li>
            <li>Total- 493 rushes, 2913 yards, 36 TD</li>
          </ul>
          <p> 
            Featuring Young, the 2005 Heisman runner-up and 3rd overall pick in the 2006 NFL Draft, and Benson, 6th place Heisman finish in 2004 and 4th overall pick in 2005 Draft, this Texas backfield is one of the most decorated in college football history.  A year after the Roberson-Sproles combo ran through the league, Big-12 defenses had to deal with the Young-Benson battery averaging 242 yards per game on the ground.  In his senior season, Benson was a model of consistency, rushing for over 150 yards eight times.  Young improved as the season went on and his 21 carry, 192 yard, and 4 touchdown performance against Michigan in the Rose Bowl remains one of the greatest bowl performances of all-time.

          <h2>#6 Auburn, 2013 </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>QB Nick Marshall- 172 rushes, 1068 yards, 12 TD</li>
            <li>RB Tre Mason- 317 rushes, 1816 yards, 23 TD</li>
            <li>Total- 489 rushes, 2884 yards, 35 TD</li>
          </ul>
          <p> 
            This pair's massive production was as surprising as Auburn's remarkable run to the 2013 BCS National Championship game as  Marshall was a junior college transfer and Mason found himself stuck in a running back by committee situation for the first few games of the season.  The two picked up steam as the season progressed, perfecting coach Gus Malzahn's attack in his first year as Auburn's head coach.   Marshall and Mason combined for 1,670 yards and 21 TDs in Auburn's final six games, including unforgettable victories over Georgia and Alabama and a heartbreaking loss to Florida State in the title game.

          <h2>#7 Arizona, 2013 </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>QB B.J. Denker- 181 rushes, 949 yards, 13 TD</li>
            <li>RB Kaâ€™Deem Carey- 349 rushes, 1885 yards,  19 TD</li>
            <li>Total- 530 rushes, 2834 yards, 32 TD</li>

          </ul>
          <p> 
            Like the White-Slaton duo, the Denker-Carey couplet put up impressive numbers in a Rich Rodriguez offense.  Carey followed up his great 2012 campaign (1929 yards, 23 TDs) with another strong season which included a 48 carry, 4 touchdown performance in a 42-16 upset of fifth ranked Oregon.  B.J. Denker took advantage of his only full season as the Wildcat starting quarterback, averaging over five yards per carry and ranking fifth nationally in QB rushing yards.  
          </p>

          <h2>#8 Ohio State, 2014 </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>QB J.T. Barrett- 171 rushes, 938 yards, 11 TD</li>
            <li>RB Ezekiel Elliot- 273 rushes, 1878 yards, 18 TD</li>
            <li>Total- 440 rushes, 2816 yards, 29 TD</li>
          </ul>
          <p> 
           The only pair in the top ten to power its team to a national championship,  the Barrett-Elliot backfield resembled Auburn's Marshall-Mason in their improvement as the season progressed.  After struggling on the ground the first three games of the year, Barrett averaged 90 yards and a touchdown per game over his last 9 contests.  When Barrett broke his ankle in the last regular season game against Michigan, Elliot elevated his game racking up  a combined 696 yards and 8 TDs in the Big Ten Championship Game, College Football Playoff Semifinal, and National Championship game to lead the Buckeyes to their first national title since 2002.

         <h2>#9 Nevada, 2010 </h2>
         <ul>
          <li>QB Colin Kaepernick- 173 rushes, 1206 yards, 20 TD</li>
          <li>RB Vai Taua- 284 rushes, 1610 yards, 19 TD</li>
          <li>Total- 457 rushes, 2816 yards, 39 TD</li>
        </ul>
        <p> 
         The 2010 edition of the Kaepernick-Taua combo was the final and most productive version of this century's most prolific QB-RB rushing duo.  Both players recorded career highs for rushing yards and rushing touchdowns in a season.  Kaepernick maintained a seven yard per carry average over the entire season while Taua managed six games of over 130 yards on the ground.  The 2010 season also was a high-water mark for the Nevada program, as the team went 13-1 and upset third ranked Boise State in their home finale.  
       </p>
       <br>


       <h2>#10 South Florida, 2016 </h2>
       <ul>
        <li>QB Quinton Flowers- 198 rushes, 1530 yards, 18 TD</li>
        <li>RB Marlon Mack- 174 rushes, 1187 yards, 15 TD</li>
        <li>Total- 372 rushes, 2717 yards, 33 TD</li>
      </ul>
      <p> 
       The most recent tandem in the top ten also has a strong argument as its most efficient.  The Flowers-Mack combination racked up over 2700 yards on an incredible 7.3 yard per carry average, leading the USF team to an impressive 11-2 record.  Mack was as dependable as would be expected for a career 3000 yard rusher, notching a rushing TD game in eleven of the Bulls' twelve games.  Flowers had a monstrous second half, gaining 1032 yards with an 8.6 yard per carry average over the season's last seven games.
