          <h2>Pac Attac(k)</h2>
          <p> 
          The Pac-12 is the Power 5 conference most wide open at the top. Three teams in both the North and South have only one conference loss while no teams are undefeated in conference play.  Stanford looked to possibly be emerging as frontrunner in the North only to look very beatable Thursday night against versus a bad Oregon State team, although the Cardinal were without super back Bryce Love,.  Two games on Saturday should do a little to separate the proverbial wheat from the proverbial chaff.  Washington State travels to Tucson to take on a suddenly explosive Arizona team led by QB Khalil Tate who is averaging an absurd 13.9 yards per carry.  Like everyone predicted in August, it will be a game featuring a Washington State defense in the top ten nationally in yards against and an Arizona team tied for the Pac-12 South lead.  If the Wildcats best the Cougars in the Large Cat Bowl, they'll share the division lead with the winner of the USC-Arizona State contest.  After the looking like they might wrap up the South crown by the end of October, the Trojans find themselves facing a game they have to win to control their own destiny.  The Sun Devils, like their Copper State counterparts, have experienced a bit of a fall renaissance.  Wins in Tempe over Oregon before the Ducks  lost starting QB Justin Herbert and at the time fifth ranked Washington along with a dominating performance against Utah in Salt Lake City have Todd Graham's squad looking like the real deal.

          <h2>ACC Playoff Hopes Getting A Bit Spooky</h2>
            <p> 
            The odds of the ACC, home to defending champ Clemson, getting a team in the College Football Playoff are not great, Robert.  Or at least, the path could be rather complicated.  The aforementioned Tigers already have a conference loss and trail NC State by a game in the  standings.  Clemson has to wrestle with Georgia Tech's triple option attack this weekend and    then travel to Raleigh next week. If they do knock off the Wolfpack, they still have games against dangerous Florida State and South Carolina teams remaining along with a possible ACC Championship game.  NC State begins a brutal back-to-back of Notre Dame-Clemson on Saturday but then closes the season with a relatively easy stretch of Boston College, Wake Forest, and North Carolina.  Though they are undefeated in ACC play, the Wolfpack do have a not-so-great loss to South Carolina.  Undefeated Miami is probably the conference's best shot for getting a team in the CFP.   The Hurricanes have looked shaky the past month and Mark Richt himself has admitted his team isn't a great or dominant squad.  They have their own difficult double feature of Virginia Tech/Notre Dame the first two weeks of November, though both games are in Miami.  Speaking of the Blacksburg boys, Virginia Tech is the dark horse in the conference.  The Hokies weren't really competitive with Clemson in a two touchdown loss but outside of that game, VT has been impressive.  If they manage to take down Miami, it seems likely they would roll into the ACC Championship game at 11-1.  Whatever scenario ends up playing out, ACC commissioner John Swofford is probably hoping for convincing NC State and Clemson wins this Saturday.
