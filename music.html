          <p> Arcade Fire lead singer Win Butler exhorts listeners to not “doubt his sincerity” on the track "Creature Comfort" from the band’s fifth full length album <em>Everything Now</em>.  However, it’s not Butler’s sincerity but rather his perceptivity and wit that is calling for scrutiny.   The band’s 2010 album <em>The Suburbs </em>was a self-conscious yet earnest exploration of cultural modernity.  It tackled well-tread ground- suburbia and familial strife, those playgrounds of New Yorker short stories- in an alluring, complex way while also being a great-sounding rock record.  Their newest work tries to be a kind of revised edition of <em>The Suburbs</em>, updated with insights on all the crazy and outlandish stuff that has been called “progress” over the last seven years.  Instead of matching their previous acuity, the band unfortunately settles for dry and predictable middle-aged commentary, which combined with an often-reckless sonic eclecticism makes for an unsteady record.
          </p>
          <p>
            Musically, Everything Now shares the most blood with 2013’s <em>Reflektor</em>, both in its dance floor ambitions and its catholicity of influences.  The titular track and first single of the album is the highlight of the record with an ABBA-like piano setting the pace while an acoustic rhythm guitar reminiscent of <em>Funeral</em>’s “Haiti”, a lively string arrangement, hand-clapping, a choir, synths, and a pygmy flute turn up to prove the band is taking Everything Now quite literally. Despite this ocean of noises, the track works because each sound is given space to live within the song and the chorus melody is catchy as hell.   Through the rest of the album, the best and most interesting instrumentation (the Blaxploitation film-style bass line of “Signs of Life” and Daniel Lanois’ pedal steel guitar in “We Don’t Deserve Love” stand out as two of the most glaring examples) are crowded out by superfluous electro-beats or trite, repetitive choruses.   And the string sections, led by the gifted Sarah Neufeld, while being the most consistently pleasing element of <em>Everything Now</em>, too often feel like mere ornamentation.  
          </p>
          <p>
            The only true monstrosity of the record is “Chemistry” a polka-disco disaster hooked up to a Billy Idol guitar riff in its chorus.  The song is comically bad and not aided by it’s somewhat creepy lyrical content in which Butler insists upon the existence of a romantic chemistry while at one point singing “Well you've got one choice, maybe two/You can leave with me or I'll go with you”.  Similarly unpalatable is the cognitive dissonance of “Good God Damn” as conga drums accompany an unsure religious awakening amidst banal considerations of suicide that can be described at best as platitudes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps the most irritating aspect of <em>Everything Now</em>, though is the finger-wagging which pervades the lyrics.  Arcade Fire is intent on telling the listener that these are not the good ole’ days, that there is no way back to them, and that the only person to blame is yourself.  From the album intro “Everything_Now (continued)” stressing the elusiveness of home (“Can't make it back again/We can just pretend/We'll make it home again”) to quickly lost childhood innocence in “Put Your Money on Me” (“We were born innocent but it lasts a day”) to the consumer determinism (“All your money is already spent on it/All your money is already spent”) of “Infinite Content” the dominant motif of the album seems to be the absolute immutability of our modern condition   Our thirst for constant information and entertainment has gotten us here, the thinking goes, and now it’s time to reap what we’ve sown.  Aside from being a boring social analysis, <em>Everything Now</em> is deeply unsatisfying coming from a band which earlier in the decade was willing and able to delve into contemporary fixation and sensibility.
